---

Dr. Haile,

I'm reaching out to invite Virginia State University's College of Engineering to partner with **Hack for RVA**, Richmond's first civic hackathon (March 27-29, 2026).

This event challenges teams to build technology solutions for Mayor Danny Avula's Action Plan — addressing housing, economic inclusion, climate resilience, and public safety in Richmond. We believe VSU students and faculty should be at the table.

**Partnership opportunities:**
- **Students as Participants:** Engineering students working on real civic challenges
- **Faculty as Mentors/Judges:** VSU expertise in infrastructure, environmental systems, data science
- **Transportation Support:** We're coordinating GRTC routes and can explore shuttle options
- **Visibility:** VSU prominently featured as a founding academic partner

**Why this matters:**
- Richmond's civic tech future should be built by all of Richmond
- VSU engineering graduates are the workforce that will implement these solutions
- Real problems, real mentorship, real portfolio projects

I'd welcome the opportunity to present this to you and discuss how VSU might engage.

Are you available for a call?

Best regards,  
[Your name]  
Hack for RVA Organizing Team
