## The Opportunity

Richmond faces real challenges: housing affordability, workforce development, environmental resilience, government efficiency. These problems don't have to be solved by government alone.

**Hack for RVA** brings together:
- **City Government** — with real problems and real data
- **Tech Community** — with skills to build solutions
- **Nonprofits** — with on-the-ground expertise
- **Business** — with resources and implementation pathways

The result? 48 hours of focused work on **7 civic challenges** aligned with Mayor Avula's Action Plan.
