# Communication Plan: Milestone Framework

## Overview

This document defines the **milestone levels** for Hack for RVA's development—a phased approach to building the event's foundation, team, and partnerships. Each level represents a significant achievement that unlocks the next phase and warrants public communication.

The framework ensures we:
- Build in the right order (foundation before team, team before pillars)
- Announce achievements at meaningful moments (not too early, not too late)
- Track progress transparently across the organizing team
- Create momentum through visible milestones

| 6. Thriving Environment | Energy companies (Dominion), environmental services |
| 7. City Stories | Media companies, tourism, cultural institutions |

### The Magic Moment

When Level 4 is complete, each pillar's Friday kickoff becomes a powerful cross-sector convening:

1. **City Hall Owner presents:** "Here's what government sees"
2. **Nonprofit Rep presents:** "Here's what's happening on the ground"
3. **Corporate Rep presents:** "Here's why business cares"
4. **Breakout Coordinator facilitates:** Team formation and Q&A

This brings City + NGO + Business leaders together at the same table, discussing the same civic challenge. That cross-sector dialogue is as valuable as the hackathon itself.

### Completion Criteria

✅ Level 3 complete (all 21 stakeholders confirmed)  
✅ All 7 pillars have confirmed Corporate Sponsor Rep  
✅ All 7 corporate sponsors have committed funding ($1K+ per pillar)  

**Level 4 = COMPLETE** when all criteria met.

>
> **28 leaders across 7 pillars:**
> 
> [Grid showing all 4 roles for each pillar]
>
> This is what happens when a city decides to solve problems together. Government, business, and community—not competing, but collaborating.
>
