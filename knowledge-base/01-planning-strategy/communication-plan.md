# Communication Plan: Milestone Framework

## Overview

This document defines the **milestone levels** for Hack for RVA's development—a phased approach to building the event's foundation, team, and partnerships. Each level represents a significant achievement that unlocks the next phase and warrants public communication.

The framework ensures we:
- Build in the right order (foundation before team, team before pillars)
- Announce achievements at meaningful moments (not too early, not too late)
- Track progress transparently across the organizing team
- Create momentum through visible milestones

---

## The Story: From Vision to Impact

Building Richmond's first civic hackathon is a journey through five acts:

1. **Act I: Foundation** — Lock the essentials (Levels 1-2)
2. **Act II: Ecosystem** — Build the cross-sector partnerships (Levels 3-5)
3. **Act III: The Work** — Create substance and staff the machine (Levels 6-8)
4. **Act IV: Resources** — Secure what we need to deliver (Levels 9-10)
5. **Act V: Launch** — Open the doors (Levels 11-12)
6. **Epilogue** — Ensure solutions live on (Level 13)

**Key Parallel Tracks:**
- **Level 6 (Challenge Design)** starts with Level 3, not after Level 5
- **Level 8 (Academia Pipeline)** has hard deadlines (field trips need 4-6 weeks) — must start early
- **Levels 9-11** can all run in parallel during the final weeks

### The Magic Moment

When Level 4 is complete, each pillar's Friday kickoff becomes a powerful cross-sector convening:

1. **City Hall Owner presents:** "Here's what government sees"
2. **Nonprofit Rep presents:** "Here's what's happening on the ground"
3. **Corporate Rep presents:** "Here's why business cares"
4. **Breakout Coordinator facilitates:** Team formation and Q&A

This brings City + NGO + Business leaders together at the same table, discussing the same civic challenge. That cross-sector dialogue is as valuable as the hackathon itself.

### Completion Criteria

✅ Level 3 complete (all 21 stakeholders confirmed)  
✅ All 7 pillars have confirmed Corporate Sponsor Rep  
✅ All 7 corporate sponsors have committed funding ($1K+ per pillar)  

**Level 4 = COMPLETE** when all criteria met.
