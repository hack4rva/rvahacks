# What to Expect at Hack for RVA

**Last Updated:** December 2024

## Overview

Hack for RVA is Richmond's first civic hackathon — 48 hours of building real solutions for our city. Here's everything you need to know about what to expect.

## What Is a Hackathon?

A hackathon is an intensive event where teams come together to build something new in a short time. Despite the name, it's not about "hacking" in the security sense — it's about rapid prototyping and creative problem-solving.

At Hack for RVA, you'll:
- Join or form a team
- Choose a civic challenge to work on
- Build a working prototype over 48 hours
- Present to judges for prizes

---

Great! Register together and come ready to work.

### Need a Team?
We have dedicated time on Friday for team formation:
1. Attend pillar breakout sessions
2. Find people interested in the same challenge
3. Mix skills (technical + non-technical = best teams)
4. Register your team on Devpost

### Ideal Team Size
**3-5 people** works best. Big enough for diverse skills, small enough to coordinate.
