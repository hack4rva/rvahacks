# Strategic Resource Mobilization Report: Powering the "Thriving Richmond" Civic Tech Hackathon

## 1. Executive Strategic Overview

The convening of a Civic Technology Hackathon in Richmond, Virginia, scheduled for March 2026, represents a pivotal moment in the region's trajectory toward becoming a premier hub for inclusive innovation and municipal excellence. This initiative serves not merely as a technical exercise but as a direct implementation vehicle for Mayor Danny Avula's Mayoral Action Plan (MAP), which was formally launched in October 2025. The MAP establishes a rigorous framework for governance, demanding a shift from abstract promises to measurable outcomes across seven distinct pillars. For the corporate and philanthropic sectors in Greater Richmond, this event offers a high-visibility platform to operationalize their Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) commitments and demonstrate alignment with the new administration's vision for a "Thriving Richmond."

Our analysis of the regional philanthropic landscape reveals a sophisticated ecosystem of corporate sponsors, private foundations, and nonprofit intermediaries that are actively seeking "action-oriented" investments. Following the release of the MAP, stakeholders are prioritizing initiatives that offer tangible metrics and structural change over passive sponsorship opportunities. A civic hackathon—which produces prototypes, data visualizations, and digital tools—provides precisely the type of "proof of concept" investment that appeals to Richmond's major donors, including Capital One, Dominion Energy, and Altria Group.

This report provides an exhaustive identification of corporate sponsors targeting the $1,000 to $50,000 range and nonprofit partners for each of the seven MAP pillars. It leverages a deep analysis of 2024 and 2025 financial disclosures, board memberships, and strategic planning documents to pinpoint decision-makers and "warm leads." The strategy articulated herein moves beyond cold outreach, utilizing the dense web of interconnectivity among Richmond's business and civic leadership to secure resources. By framing the hackathon as a "Civilian R&D Lab" for the City's toughest challenges, the organizing committee can unlock significant capital and volunteer talent.

The following sections dissect each pillar, providing a narrative analysis of the problem space, the ideal corporate partners, and the nonprofit beneficiaries that will ground the technology in community needs.

## 2. Pillar 1: A Thriving City Hall (That Gets Things Done)

The first pillar of the MAP, "A Thriving City Hall," is foundational to the success of the entire administration. It focuses on transforming Richmond's local government into a model public-sector organization that stewards resources effectively, reduces employee vacancy rates, and improves core operations. The Mayor has explicitly called for a government that "gets the basics right" and uses data as a "measuring stick" for accountability.

### Strategic Context for Sponsorship

Sponsors for this track will be drawn largely from the GovTech and B2B services sector. These companies have a vested interest in demonstrating how their technologies can modernize legacy systems. The pitch here is about "Operational Excellence" and "Digital Transformation." The outputs of this track—such as procurement visualization dashboards, FOIA request trackers, or permit status notification tools—directly serve the business community by reducing administrative friction.

### Corporate Sponsor Candidates

**Tyler Technologies** — Tyler Technologies stands as a paramount candidate for sponsorship within this pillar due to its entrenched status as a strategic partner to Virginia's public sector. With a dedicated team of Virginia government experts based in Richmond, Tyler Technologies holds critical eGovernment services contracts with the Virginia IT Agency (VITA) and services 245 government agencies across the Commonwealth. Their business model is predicated on "connected communities," making a civic hackathon an ideal showroom for their commitment to frictionless citizen-government interaction. Matt Crane, the Virginia Team Lead, has publicly articulated the company's mission to equip communities with technology that connects data, people, and processes, specifically citing their work in streamlining payment processing and school transportation. Engaging Tyler Technologies at the $10,000–$25,000 level would likely unlock not just funding but access to mentorship from their deep bench of solution architects.

**Carahsoft Technology Corp.** — As the "Master Government Aggregator," Carahsoft is a juggernaut in the public sector IT landscape, managing contracts for hundreds of software manufacturers and holding over 220 government contract vehicles. Although headquartered in Reston, their influence pervades Richmond's state and local government technology procurement channels. Carahsoft sponsors hundreds of events annually, ranging from executive roundtables to technology forums, indicating a robust budget for event marketing. Their sponsorship would lend significant credibility to the hackathon, signaling to other vendors that this is a premier GovTech event. Tina Chiao, a long-time Director at Carahsoft with expertise in managing the AWS business and partner development, represents a strategic entry point. A sponsorship pitch to Carahsoft should emphasize the opportunity to network with city CIOs and IT directors who often attend such innovation showcases.

## 9. Cross-Pillar Sponsors & Relevant Foundations

Several entities have mandates that cut across all pillars. These are ideal targets for general operating support or special "Grand Prize" sponsorships.

**Community Foundation for a greater Richmond** — The largest community foundation in the region, with specific grant focus areas in community vibrancy, economic prosperity, and educational success. They manage donor-advised funds and could be a conduit for multiple individual donors.
- **Contact:** Sherrie Armstrong, President & CEO

**Bob & Anna Lou Schaberg Foundation** — A private foundation focused on housing, workforce development, and stability for vulnerable populations. They operate by invitation but are key players in the "Richmond Funders Collaborative".
- **Contact Strategy:** Access via a warm introduction through the Funders Collaborative partners (e.g., Robins Foundation)

**Richmond Memorial Health Foundation (RMHF)** — Focused heavily on health and racial equity. They offer "Opportunity Investments" that could fund specific equity-focused tracks.
- **Contact:** Mark Constantine, President & CEO

## 10. "Warm Connections" via Local Networks

Unlocking these sponsorships requires navigating the "web of influence" in Richmond. The following individuals bridge multiple organizations and are high-value targets for initial outreach.

| Influencer | Primary Role | Network Connection | Strategy |
|------------|--------------|-------------------|----------|
| Jennifer Hunter | SVP, Altria | Board Chair, Community Foundation; Board, ChamberRVA; Board, Points of Light | The nexus of corporate giving. Pitch the entire event to her as a community vibrancy initiative. |
| Matt Briggs | VP Product, Capital One | Board Chair, Startup Virginia | Use him to unlock Capital One and the startup ecosystem. He understands the "tech + equity" value prop. |
| Will Willis | Director, Ippon Tech | Board Chair, AI Ready RVA | The entry point for "Tech" specific sponsorships. Bridges corporate consulting and nonprofit tech literacy. |
| Mitch Haddon | CEO, ColonialWebb | Chair, ChamberRVA (2025) | As Chamber Chair, he can endorse the event to the broader business community. |
| Richard Wintsch | Exec. Dir, Startup VA | Board, ChamberRVA (Economic Inclusion) | Use him to validate the event to the startup/investor community. |

## 11. Conclusion & Implementation Timeline

To successfully mobilize these resources for a March 2026 event, the organizing committee must adopt a phased approach. The "Mayor's Challenge" brand should be leveraged immediately to secure Anchor Sponsors (Capital One, Dominion) by September 2025. Their commitment will validate the event, allowing the committee to secure mid-tier sponsors ($5k-$15k) throughout Q4 2025. By framing the hackathon as a mechanism for action rather than just ideation, the committee can tap into the deep desire across Richmond's corporate and philanthropic sectors to help the new administration succeed. This report provides the contact map; the next step is execution.
