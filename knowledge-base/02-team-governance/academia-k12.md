Strategic Integration Framework: Greater Richmond Civic Hackathon (March 27–29)

Executive Summary

The Greater Richmond region stands at a critical juncture in the evolution of its educational and civic ecosystems. The convergence of heightened graduation requirements centered on "Real World Learning" in K–12 divisions, the robust "Service Learning" mandates within local universities, and the City of Richmond’s urgent need for data-driven climate solutions (via RVAgreen 2050) creates a unique opportunity. This report outlines a comprehensive, execution-ready strategic plan to recruit, prepare, and support students from Richmond Public Schools (RPS), Henrico County Public Schools (HCPS), Chesterfield County Public Schools (CCPS), and regional higher education institutions for a civic hackathon scheduled for March 27–29.
This initiative is designed not as an isolated extracurricular event, but as a structural component of the regional workforce development pipeline. By aligning the hackathon’s activities with the Virginia Department of Education’s (VDOE) "Profile of a Virginia Graduate," specifically targeting the Work-Based Learning (WBL) and Civic Education Diploma Seals, the event transitions from a "nice-to-have" to a "need-to-have" for school administrators.
The timing of the event—March 27–29—presents a complex matrix of opportunities and logistical threats. Occurring immediately prior to Spring Break for several major districts and coinciding with specific religious observances (Eid al-Fitr) and potential "banked time" holidays for Governor’s Schools, the recruitment strategy requires a surgical approach to scheduling.
This document provides an exhaustive ecosystem map, identifying key personnel within the Career and Technical Education (CTE) departments of each division. It details a rigorous risk management framework based on Virginia Commonwealth University’s (VCU) "Safety and Protection of Minors" policy to navigate the liability of mixing minors and adults. Furthermore, it leverages the region’s transit infrastructure, specifically the GRTC Pulse "Zero Fare" network, to ensure equitable access. The following sections dismantle the traditional hackathon model and rebuild it as a civic-academic partnership engine.

Section 1: The Educational Landscape: A District-by-District Deep Dive

To successfully integrate K–12 students, the hackathon must be positioned as a solution to the specific accreditation and strategic challenges faced by each school division. A generic outreach strategy will fail; success requires speaking the specific dialect of each district’s strategic plan.

1.1 Richmond Public Schools (RPS): Equity and Real-World Learning

RPS serves as the geographic and civic heart of the initiative. The division’s strategic direction is heavily oriented toward equity and providing "Real World Learning" opportunities for a student body that is predominantly economically disadvantaged.

1.1.1 Strategic Alignment & Motivation

The primary lever for RPS engagement is the division's need to boost its "College, Career, and Civic Readiness" (CCCR) accreditation indicators. The VDOE’s accreditation standards reward schools for students who complete WBL experiences.
WBL Mandate: RPS actively promotes "Career Connected Experiences" such as job shadowing and service learning. The hackathon must be formally categorized as a "Service Learning" or "Job Shadowing" event (specifically for the Friday, March 27 session) to allow teachers to justify field trip approvals.
Curriculum Integration: The 2024 Computer Science Standards of Learning (SOLs) emphasize "Impacts of Computing" and "Data Analysis". By utilizing RVAgreen 2050 data, the hackathon directly fulfills these instructional requirements, particularly for high school CS courses offered at Richmond Community High School and Open High School.
1.1.2 Key Personnel & Infrastructure

CTE Leadership: The central point of contact is Dr. Rhonda Turner, Associate Director of Career and Technical Education. Dr. Turner oversees the implementation of WBL and is the gatekeeper for district-wide CTE initiatives. Engagement should also include Instructional Specialists like Shana Griffin (Trade & Industrial) and Parcilla Salley (Business/IT).
Richmond Technical Center (RTC): Located on Westwood Avenue, RTC is the hub for the division’s most advanced technical students. Principal Jonathan Mitchum and Assistant Principal Christopher Jacobs manage programs that align directly with hackathon tracks (coding, cybersecurity).
Superintendent’s Advisory Councils: Leveraging the Student Advisory Council (SAC) and Teacher Advisory Council (TAC) is a high-yield recruitment strategy. These bodies meet monthly and can disseminate information directly to the most engaged stakeholders.
1.1.3 Calendar & Logistics Analysis

Dates: The RPS calendar indicates March 27 is a regular school day. The "End of Quarter" is March 21, meaning students are in a "lull" period before Spring Break begins April 1.
Risk Factors: Eid al-Fitr is observed on March 31 (RPS Closed), and Spring Break follows immediately. This proximity creates a risk of high absenteeism on Friday, March 27, if families start vacations early.
Mitigation: Position the Friday event as a "capstone" field trip that concludes a unit of study, making attendance mandatory for participating classes.
1.2 Henrico County Public Schools (HCPS): The "Life-Ready" Initiative

HCPS operates a sophisticated, large-scale CTE program under the brand "Henrico Workforce & Career Development." The division’s "Life-Ready" graduate profile emphasizes skills that are perfectly mirrored by a hackathon environment: collaboration, communication, and critical thinking.

1.2.1 Strategic Alignment & Motivation

Henrico’s specific "Life-Ready" goals are the entry point. The division heavily promotes the Advanced Career Education (ACE) centers at Hermitage and Highland Springs.
CTE Business Advisory Council: HCPS has a robust Business Advisory Council (BAC) that meets quarterly. Presenting the hackathon to this council is critical for district-wide buy-in.
Diploma Seals: HCPS aggressively promotes the Civics Education and STEM diploma seals. The hackathon must provide documentation (logs) that explicitly track hours towards these 50-hour requirements.
1.2.2 Key Personnel & Infrastructure

Leadership: Mac Beaton, Director of Workforce & Career Development, is a nationally recognized leader in CTE and a primary stakeholder. His support essentially guarantees the participation of the ACE centers.
Specialists: Fahryka Bray (Business & Marketing) and Beverly Cocke (Administrative Coordinator) are the operational contacts for distributing information to teachers.
School Contacts: The Center for Information Technology at Deep Run High School and the ACE Centers are the highest-value targets for recruitment.
1.2.3 Calendar & Logistics Analysis

Dates: HCPS schools are in session March 27. Spring Break begins March 30.
Field Trip Protocol: HCPS has a strict 6-week lead time for commercial bus requests and 4 weeks for school bus requests.
Critical Deadline: Bus requests must be submitted by February 13, 2026 to ensure availability for the Friday session.
1.3 Chesterfield County Public Schools (CCPS): Engineering and STEAM

CCPS is the largest division in the region and houses specialized Governor’s Academies that focus heavily on engineering and hard sciences.

1.3.1 Strategic Alignment & Motivation

CCPS utilizes the "3E Readiness" framework (Enrollment, Employment, Enlistment). The hackathon falls under the "Employment" (WBL) and "Enrollment" (College Prep) pillars.
Governor’s Academy for Engineering Studies: Located at L.C. Bird High School, this academy is the premier partner for hardware and engineering-focused hackathon projects. Dr. Nancy Hoover is the director and key gatekeeper.
WBL Tracking: CCPS uses specific systems for logging WBL hours. The hackathon must provide digital certificates or signed logs compatible with their tracking systems.
1.3.2 Key Personnel & Infrastructure

CTE Leadership: Chad Maclin, Director of Career and Technical Education, and Dr. Emily Stains, Director of Secondary Curriculum.
School Board: The CTE Advisory Committee meets monthly (e.g., Dec 16, June 17). Getting on the January or February agenda is essential.
1.3.3 Calendar & Logistics Analysis

Dates: CCPS is in session March 27. Spring Break is March 30–April 3.
Logistics: Given the distance of schools like L.C. Bird from downtown Richmond, transportation is a major hurdle. The use of CCPS activity buses is possible but requires funding and driver availability, which is often scarce.
1.4 Regional & Specialty Schools: The High-Performance Cohorts

1.4.1 CodeRVA Regional High School

CodeRVA is designed specifically for computer science and workforce integration.
Alignment: Their "blended learning" model and internship requirements make them the single most compatible partner. Students already participate in 200+ hour internships.
Logistics: The school is located near the Diamond, accessible via public transit (though not directly on the Pulse line). March 27 is a standard school day.
Action: Contact the Executive Director to frame the hackathon as a "Flex Day" activity or a sanctioned off-site learning experience.
1.4.2 Maggie L. Walker Governor’s School (MLWGS)

The "Snow Day" Opportunity: The MLWGS calendar contains a specific provision: "If fewer than 5 instructional days are lost, then March 27 becomes a School Holiday".
Strategic Implication: If the winter is mild, MLWGS students will be off school on the Friday of the hackathon. This allows them to participate in a full-day "Hackathon Kickoff" without the bureaucratic hurdles of a field trip. Recruitment for this group should be framed as a high-level extracurricular enrichment opportunity.
Section 2: The Higher Education Nexus

While K–12 participation relies on mandates, university participation relies on career advancement and service learning requirements.

2.1 Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU)

As the downtown anchor, VCU is the logical host and primary source of mentors.
College of Engineering: The Department of Computer Science (Dr. Kemal Akkaya, Chair) and student orgs like ACM and RamDev are critical.
Service Learning: VCU has a designated Service Learning Office. By registering the hackathon as a "Service Learning Designated" activity, it allows faculty to integrate participation into their syllabi (e.g., CMSC 441 Senior Design).
Da Vinci Center: This cross-disciplinary innovation hub offers the Shift Retail Lab as a venue. Their focus on "product innovation" aligns with the hackathon's output goals.
2.2 University of Richmond (UR)

Bonner Center for Civic Engagement (CCE): The CCE is the gateway to UR’s civic-minded students. Sylvia Gale, Executive Director, and Blake Stack, Senior Associate Director of Student Engagement, are the targets for partnership.
Transportation: UR is geographically separated from downtown. The CCE operates shuttles and has a "City Excursions" program that could be leveraged to transport students to the event.
2.3 Virginia State University (VSU)

Engagement: VSU’s engineering and computer science departments (Dr. Dawit Haile, Dean) are vital for ensuring diversity. The hackathon should offer a "transportation scholarship" or chartered bus from Ettrick to ensure VSU students can attend without logistical friction.
Section 3: Curriculum Alignment & Credentialing Mechanisms

To ensure durable partnerships, the hackathon must produce artifacts that schools can use for accreditation.

3.1 The "Diploma Seal" Ecosystem

Virginia students can earn several seals on their diplomas. The hackathon must be explicitly marketed as a qualifying activity for two specific seals:

3.1.1 The Board of Education’s Excellence in Civics Education Seal

Requirement: 50 hours of voluntary community service.
Hackathon Fit: By framing the event as "Civic Tech"—building tools for the public good (e.g., using RVAgreen 2050 data)—participation counts as civic service.
Action: Provide a "Civics Service Log" at the event registration desk where students can log ~15-20 hours (Friday-Sunday).
3.1.2 The Board of Education’s STEM Seal

Requirement: 50 hours (or 25 for certain cohorts) of WBL in a STEM area.
Hackathon Fit: The event qualifies as a "Service Learning" or "Job Shadowing" WBL experience.
Action: Issue a formal "WBL Verification Letter" signed by the event organizers and corporate partners (e.g., rvatech/) that outlines the specific STEM competencies demonstrated.
3.2 2024 Computer Science Standards of Learning (SOLs)

The new 2024 SOLs provide a curriculum hook. The hackathon aligns with:
Data & Analysis (High School): "The student will select and use data analysis tools to analyze and visualize data to support a claim or answer a question".
Impacts of Computing: "The student will evaluate the social and economic implications of computing technologies".
Teacher Pitch: "Bring your students to the hackathon to satisfy the 'Data Analysis' and 'Impacts of Computing' strands of the new 2024 SOLs in a single weekend."
Section 4: Legal, Risk, and Compliance Framework

Mixing minors (K–12) with adults (university/professionals) creates a high-liability environment. Adherence to VCU’s "Safety and Protection of Minors on Campus" policy is the baseline standard for the event.

4.1 Policy Structure: The Tier System

VCU’s policy categorizes individuals based on their interaction level with minors.
Tier
Definition
Requirements for Hackathon Staff
Tier I
Supervisors/Point Persons with unsupervised access.
Multi-state criminal background check + Sex Offender Registry check (biennial). Mandatory Training.
Tier II
Program Staff (Mentors) with one-on-one interaction.
Background check + Training.
Tier III
Volunteers with supervised group interaction only.
No background check required if always under Tier I/II supervision.
4.2 Operationalizing Risk Management

The "Rule of Two": Never allow a minor to be alone with a single adult. Always two adults present. This must be briefed to all participants.
Visual Identification: Minors must be instantly distinguishable from adults.
Implementation: Use color-coded lanyards (e.g., RED for Minors, GREEN for University Students, BLUE for Background-Checked Mentors/Staff).
Registration Deadline: VCU requires programs to register 30 days in advance. For a March 27 event, the hard deadline for registration is February 25, 2025.
Chaperone Ratios: The event must maintain a 1:10 adult-to-minor ratio.
Strategy: Use K-12 teachers as the primary chaperones. They are already background-checked state employees. This shifts the "custody" burden back to the school district during the Friday field trip portion.
4.3 Liability Insurance

If the event is not officially sponsored by VCU/UR, independent Special Event Liability Insurance is required.
Cost: Approximately $160-$300 for a 3-day event with ~200 attendees.
Coverage: Minimum $1,000,000 per occurrence / $2,000,000 aggregate.
Providers: GatherGuard, Eventsured, or Markel (Richmond-based).
4.4 Data Privacy (COPPA/FERPA)

Consent: A comprehensive permission slip is required. It must include:
Medical release (allergies, emergency contacts).
Media release (photo/video).
Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) for internet access.
Liability waiver holding the venue and organizers harmless.
Section 5: Operational Logistics: Venue, Transport, and Infrastructure

5.1 Venue Selection and Cost Analysis

Two primary venues fit the criteria for downtown accessibility and capacity.

Option A: VCU Shift Retail Lab / Da Vinci Center

Pros: High "cool factor," designed for innovation, low/no cost for VCU-affiliated events. Located on Broad St (Pulse Line).
Cons: Strict adherence to university policies; space may be limited for 200+ people.
Cost: $0 (if partnered) to ~$1,000 (custodial/security fees).
Option B: Main Street Station (The Shed)

Pros: Iconic Richmond landmark, massive capacity, direct transit access (Pulse + Amtrak).
Cons: High cost. Rental rates start at $3,350 for peak season. Requires external catering and security.
Recommendation: Use VCU Shift Retail Lab for the pilot year to minimize costs and maximize university integration.
5.2 Transportation Strategy: The "Zero Fare" Advantage

Transportation is often the single biggest barrier to equity.
GRTC Pulse: The Pulse Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) is Zero Fare. It runs every 15 minutes and connects Willow Lawn (Henrico) to Rockett’s Landing (City/Henrico border), passing VCU and downtown.
Strategy: Create "Pulse Guides" for each school.
Example: "CodeRVA Students: Walk to The Diamond Station -> Pulse Eastbound -> Exit at VCU/VUU Station."
School Buses: For the Friday "Field Trip" track, buses must be requested by mid-February (6 weeks prior).
Cost: Approx. $300-$500 per bus per day if charged to the event (varies by district policy).
5.3 Catering and Sustenance

To keep students engaged, food is critical.
Budgeting: Estimate $40/head for the weekend (Friday lunch/dinner, Sat breakfast/lunch/dinner, Sun lunch).
Local Options:
The Savory Grain: Boxed lunches ~$12-$15/person.
Big Herm's Catering: Buffet options ~$13/person.
Pizza: The staple option for Saturday night ($8/person).
Section 6: Thematic Integration: RVAgreen 2050 & Civic Data

To satisfy the "Civic" requirement of the diploma seal, the hackathon must address a real public need.

6.1 RVAgreen 2050

Context: The City’s equity-centered climate action plan. It focuses on reducing emissions and heat vulnerability in marginalized neighborhoods.
Data Source: The Richmond Open Data Portal and RVAgreen 2050 technical appendices provide datasets on:
Urban Heat Island effect maps.
Flood risk zones.
Energy burden by census tract.
Challenge Prompt: "Create a digital tool that helps a Richmond resident understand their specific climate risk and access city resources."
6.2 CodeVA & Education Partners

CodeVA: As a partner, CodeVA can validate the curriculum. The event can serve as a "practicum" for teachers undergoing CodeVA training.
RVA Tech Council (rvatech/): Partnering with rvatech/ opens access to their "NextGen" awards and member companies (Capital One, CarMax) for judges and mentors.
Section 7: Phased Implementation Plan

Phase 1: Foundation & Approval (October - December)

Week 1-4: Secure venue (VCU Shift Lab). Form Steering Committee with rep from VCU Engineering, UR CCE, and CodeVA.
Week 5-8: Meet with CTE Directors (Turner at RPS, Beaton at HCPS) to get "WBL Approval." This is the "Green Light" for teachers.
Week 9-12: Draft legal waivers and register with VCU Protection of Minors office.
Phase 2: Activation & Recruitment (January - February)

Jan 15: Launch website. Open registration for "Mentors" (University students) and "Participants" (K-12).
Feb 1: Distribute "Teacher Toolkits" to CS faculty at CodeRVA, MLWGS, and ACE Centers.
Feb 15: CRITICAL DEADLINE: Submit bus transportation requests for Friday, March 27 field trips.
Feb 25: CRITICAL DEADLINE: Finalize VCU Minors Registration (30 days out).
Phase 3: The Blitz (March)

March 1-15: "Lecture Hall Storming" at VCU/UR to recruit college students.
March 20: Final confirmation of chaperone background checks.
March 27-29: Event Execution.
