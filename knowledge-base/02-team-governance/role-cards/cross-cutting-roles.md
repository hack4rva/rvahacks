### Description

The Data Ambassador is a civic data generalist who helps teams across all 7 pillars understand Richmond's data landscape. They explain what datasets exist, their limitations, and how to use them properly—preventing teams from solving the wrong problems due to data misunderstandings.

### You Own

- Attend Friday orientation to meet pillar stakeholders and understand data landscape
- Be available via Discord throughout Saturday hacking (6-8 hrs, can be intermittent)
- Respond to team data questions in #data-help channel
- Explain what datasets exist and their limitations
- Clarify what the data actually measures vs. what teams assume
- Point teams to relevant datasets, APIs, and resources
- Help teams avoid common data pitfalls
- Coordinate with City Data Liaison for access questions
- Flag data requests that need escalation

### You Escalate

| Situation | Escalate To | Channel |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Team needs data access not publicly available | City Data Liaison | Discord DM |

### Success Criteria

- Respond to data questions within 15 minutes during active hours
- At least 10 teams receive data guidance

- **Richmond-specific expertise** — Familiarity with local data sources and their quirks
- **Teaching ability** — Can explain complex data concepts to non-experts
- **Data literacy** — Understand data structures, APIs, common formats

### Skills Preferred

- Experience with Richmond Open Data Portal
- Familiarity with GRTC GTFS data
- Knowledge of Census and ACS data
- Experience with housing/eviction data (RVA Eviction Lab)
- Previous hackathon mentoring experience
- GIS/mapping skills

### Time Budget

| Day | Hours | Focus |
|-----|-------|-------|
| Friday | 1 hr | Orientation with pillar stakeholders |
| Saturday | 6-8 hrs | On-call via Discord (can be intermittent) |
| Sunday | 0 hrs | Not needed (teams have submitted) |

### Communication

**Discord Presence:**
- Primary channel: #data-help
- Also monitor: #general, pillar-specific channels
- Respond to @data-ambassador mentions

**Availability Signal:**
- Set Discord status to indicate availability
- Post availability windows in #data-help at start of day
- Hand off to City Data Liaison if going offline

### Common Questions to Expect

| Question Type | Example | Response Approach |
|---------------|---------|-------------------|
| Data source | "Where can I find eviction data?" | Point to RVA Eviction Lab, explain what it includes |
| Data meaning | "What does this housing code mean?" | Explain the classification system |
| Data access | "Can I get real-time bus data?" | Point to GRTC GTFS, explain format |
| Data quality | "Is this data reliable?" | Explain collection method, known issues |
| Data combination | "Can I combine these two datasets?" | Explain join keys, potential issues |

### Common Data Sources by Pillar

| Pillar | Key Data Sources |
|--------|------------------|
| 1. Thriving City Hall | City budget data, service request data, 311 data |
| 2. Thriving Neighborhoods | RVA Eviction Lab, housing permits, zoning data |
| 3. Thriving Families | School data, youth program data, census demographics |
| 4. Thriving Economy | Business licenses, SWaM directory, employment data |
| 5. Inclusive Communities | Health department data, demographic data, equity indices |
| 6. Thriving Environment | Climate data, tree canopy, stormwater, energy data |
| 7. City Stories | Historical records, Shockoe project data, cultural sites |

### Pre-Event Preparation

- [ ] Review all data sources for each pillar
- [ ] Test API access and note any issues
- [ ] Create quick-reference sheet of common datasets
- [ ] Meet with City Data Liaison to understand access protocols
- [ ] Set up Discord notifications for data channels
- [ ] Prepare list of external data sources (Census, state data, etc.)

### Notes

- This is a generalist role — you don't need to know everything, but know where to find answers
- Quality over speed — better to give a thoughtful answer than a quick wrong one
- If you don't know, say so and escalate to City Data Liaison
- Document common questions for future events
