# Pillar Ecosystem: Cross-Sector Partnerships

## Overview

Each of the 7 pillars in Mayor Avula's Action Plan has a complete stakeholder ecosystem consisting of:

1. **City Liaison** — Government representative who champions the pillar
2. **Nonprofit Partner** — Organization working on-the-ground in this domain
3. **Corporate Sponsor** — Company funding the pillar award and bringing business perspective

This creates **21 key stakeholder relationships** (7 pillars × 3 roles) that must be recruited and coordinated.

Additionally, **1 Data Ambassador** serves across all pillars as a cross-cutting resource.

---

## The Magic Moment

The pillar ecosystem creates a unique convening opportunity:

**Friday Kickoff per Pillar:**
- City Liaison presents: "Here's what government sees"
- Nonprofit Envoy presents: "Here's what's happening on the ground"
- Corporate Sponsor presents: "Here's why business cares"

This brings City + NGO + Business leaders together at the same table, discussing the same civic challenge. That cross-sector dialogue is as valuable as the hackathon itself.

**Sunday Judging:**
- Nonprofit envoys judge their pillar awards
- Creates accountability: the people who know the problem best evaluate solutions
