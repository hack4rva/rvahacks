## Autonomy Framework

Every volunteer role is defined with a **Role Card** that includes:

1. **You Own** — What you're responsible for (autonomy)
2. **You Escalate** — When to escalate and to whom (boundaries)
3. **Decision Authority** — What you can decide yourself (empowerment)
4. **Success Criteria** — How you know you did well (clarity)

This gives volunteers focused assignments with clear autonomy while ensuring issues get routed appropriately.

**See:** [Role Cards Directory](./role-cards/)
