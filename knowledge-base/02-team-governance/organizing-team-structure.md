# Comprehensive Organizing Team Structure

## Overview

This document defines the **accountability owner teams** for Hack for RVA — the 36-52 people who organize and run the hackathon (distinct from the 150-200 volunteers who staff it).

While [volunteer-system.md](./volunteer-system.md) focuses on **when** people work (phases), this document focuses on **what** they own (functional accountability).

---

## Organizational Philosophy

Each team has:
- **Core Mission**: Clear purpose statement
- **Responsibilities**: What they own
- **Key Challenges**: Anticipated friction points
- **Team Size**: How many people needed
- **Success Metrics**: How to know they succeeded

Teams are grouped into **functional clusters** that represent related areas of accountability.

---

## 3. RESOURCE ACQUISITION CLUSTER

### Corporate Sponsorships Team

**Core Mission**: Secure funding and in-kind support from private sector companies

**Responsibilities**:
- **Prospecting**: Identify and prioritize corporate targets across tiers:
  - Title Sponsor: $50K+
  - Pillar Sponsors: $25K
  - Challenge Sponsors: $10K
  - Supporting Sponsors: $5K
- **Pitch Development**: Create compelling sponsorship decks highlighting ROI (talent pipeline, brand visibility, civic impact alignment)

- **Fulfillment**: Ensure sponsors receive promised benefits (logo placement, speaking opportunities, booth space, judge participation)
- **Non-Passive Engagement**: Structure sponsor involvement beyond writing checks (custom rubrics, mentorship, recruiting presence)

**Key Challenges**:
- Richmond's corporate landscape is smaller than major tech hubs (need to be strategic about targets)
- Competing with other civic/nonprofit sponsorship requests
- Delivering value to sponsors beyond "good PR"
- Managing sponsor expectations around outcomes and brand visibility

**Team Size**: 3-4 people
- **Lead**: Strategy and primary relationship owner for major sponsors
- **Outreach Coordinators (2)**: Prospecting, pitch delivery, follow-up
- **Fulfillment Manager**: Ensures sponsor benefits are delivered, manages logos/branding integration

- $150K-$200K in total corporate sponsorship revenue
- All 7 MAP pillars have at least one corporate sponsor
- 80%+ sponsor satisfaction (measured post-event)
- 50%+ sponsors commit to returning for Year 2

**Strategic Note**: This team should coordinate with **Nonprofit Sponsorships Team** to ensure coherent narrative across all sponsors. Consider creating tiered partnership packages that bundle corporate funding with nonprofit community expertise.

---

### Nonprofit Sponsorships Team

**Core Mission**: Partner with community organizations to provide lived experience, community validation, and grassroots expertise across all 7 MAP pillars

**Responsibilities**:
- **Pillar Mapping**: Identify nonprofit organizations aligned with each MAP pillar:
  - **Thriving City Hall**: Good government groups, civic engagement orgs
  - **Thriving Neighborhoods**: Affordable housing advocates, neighborhood associations
  - **Thriving Families**: Youth development, education support organizations
  - **Thriving Economy**: Workforce development, small business support, OCWB partners
  - **Thriving Communities**: Immigrant services, LGBTQ+ advocacy, health equity orgs
  - **Sustainable Built Environment**: Environmental justice groups, climate advocates
  - **Telling Stories**: Cultural organizations, historical societies, arts groups
- **Partnership Development**: Secure commitments for nonprofit involvement (challenge definition, judging, community validation, post-event implementation support)
- **Stakeholder Coordination**: Work with city officials (Caprichia Smith Spellman at OCWB, Bobby Vincent Jr. at DPW, Merrick Malone at HCD) to identify trusted community partners
- **Equity Assurance**: Ensure solutions developed address real community needs, not just interesting technical problems

**Key Challenges**:
- Nonprofits have limited capacity to engage without compensation
- Avoiding extractive relationships (community provides expertise without benefit)
- Ensuring authentic community voice versus tokenistic participation
- Managing expectations around what hackathon can realistically accomplish for their issue areas

**Team Size**: 3-4 people
- **Lead**: Overall partnership strategy and city stakeholder coordination
- **Pillar Coordinators (2-3)**: Each owns 2-3 pillars, cultivates deep relationships with 3-5 orgs per pillar
- **Community Engagement Specialist**: Ensures equitable participation structures, manages compensation/recognition for nonprofit partners

**Success Metrics**:
- All 7 MAP pillars have 2-3 engaged nonprofit partners

- Community organizations report positive experience and willingness to engage in future civic tech initiatives

**Strategic Note**: This is arguably your most important team for ensuring the hackathon produces *implementable* solutions rather than tech demos. Consider creating a small stipend/honorarium budget to compensate nonprofit leaders for their time and expertise. This team should also feed insights back to the **Pre-Event Preparation Team** to ensure problem frames reflect authentic community priorities.

## 4. PARTICIPANT EXPERIENCE & RECOGNITION CLUSTER

### Gifts & Swag Team

**Core Mission**: Create memorable participant experience through branded materials and manage prize distribution

**Responsibilities**:
- **T-Shirt Design & Production**: Create design reflecting hackathon brand (aligned with Anthropic's minimalist aesthetic and MAP's civic mission), select vendor, manage sizing/ordering/pickup
- **Swag Bag Curation**: Source and assemble participant packages (stickers, notebooks, water bottles, local Richmond items to showcase city pride)
- **Prize Money Administration**: Coordinate with **Judging Team** and sponsors to structure prize distribution (Grand Prize, Pillar Winners, Special Awards), manage payment logistics (checks vs. direct deposit vs. platform distribution)
- **Logistics**: Coordinate with **On-Site Operations Team** and **Volunteer Management Team** for distribution at registration

**Key Challenges**:
- Budget constraints (swag can consume significant budget without adding substance)
- Sizing accuracy for t-shirts (always someone unhappy)
- Prize tax implications (if prizes exceed $600, winners need tax documentation)
- Balancing "cool swag" with sustainability values (avoiding disposable junk)

**Team Size**: 2-3 people
- **Lead**: Overall swag strategy and budget management
- **Design & Production Coordinator**: T-shirt design, vendor management
- **Prize Administrator**: Financial logistics for awards distribution

**Success Metrics**:
- All 300 participants receive swag bags at registration
- 90%+ satisfaction with swag quality (post-event survey)
- Prize distribution completed within 2 weeks of event
- Zero payment/tax compliance issues

**Strategic Note**: Consider partnering with local Richmond businesses for swag items (local coffee roasters, Richmond-made goods) to reinforce civic pride. Swag should feel professional and mission-driven, not startup-y or frivolous. The t-shirt design is a long-term branding asset—participants wearing it becomes mobile advertising for Richmond civic tech.

---

### Entries & Platform Management Team

**Core Mission**: Administer technical infrastructure for submissions, project management, and participant communication

**Responsibilities**:
- **Devpost Administration**: Configure hackathon page, create submission templates aligned with MAP pillars, manage project approvals, coordinate with **Judging Team** on evaluation workflow
- **GitHub Organization**: Set up repositories for code submissions, ensure proper licensing (open source civic code), manage access controls
- **Discord/Slack Setup**: Create channel structure (general, per-challenge-area, help desk, announcements, social), configure bots, manage permissions—coordinate with **Hacking Support Team** on ongoing management
- **Testing & Validation**: Conduct end-to-end testing of all platforms 2-3 weeks before event, identify and resolve issues
- **Account Management**: Create and distribute credentials for participants, judges, sponsors, volunteers as appropriate

**Key Challenges**:
- Platform integration (Devpost, GitHub, Discord/Slack don't naturally talk to each other)
- Access control complexity (different permission levels for participants vs. judges vs. organizers)
- Disaster recovery planning (what if Devpost goes down Sunday morning?)
- Post-event data management (preserving projects, ensuring open source licenses are respected)

**Team Size**: 2-3 people
- **Lead**: Overall platform architecture and integration strategy
- **Devpost/Submissions Manager**: Hackathon platform configuration and submission workflow
- **Communications Platform Manager**: Discord/Slack setup and ongoing admin support (coordinate with **Hacking Support Team**)

**Success Metrics**:
- All platforms operational and tested 1 week before event
- Zero platform-related submission failures
- Smooth handoff to **Hacking Support Team** for day-of management
- Post-event archive of all projects accessible to city stakeholders

**Strategic Note**: This team should create documentation for future hackathons (playbook for platform setup). Consider creating a "How to Submit" tutorial video to reduce last-minute panic Sunday afternoon. The platform architecture should support the post-event goal: connecting winning teams with city departments and nonprofit partners for implementation.

---

## 5. EXTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS & BRAND CLUSTER

### Marketing Team

**Core Mission**: Build awareness, drive registrations, and establish Richmond Civic Tech Hackathon as a premier event

**Responsibilities**:
- **Brand Development**: Create visual identity system (logo, color palette, typography) aligned with Anthropic minimalist aesthetic and MAP's civic seriousness
- **Website**: Build and maintain event website with registration, FAQs, schedule, sponsor logos, challenge area descriptions
- **Social Media Strategy**: Develop content calendar and voice for LinkedIn (professional, policy-focused), Instagram (visual, community-focused), potential Twitter/X for real-time event updates
- **Content Creation**: Blog posts featuring MAP pillars, spotlight nonprofit partners, profile city stakeholders, explain challenge areas
- **Media Relations**: Pitch to Richmond Times-Dispatch, Richmond Magazine, local TV stations, tech press (GovTech, StateScoop)
- **Participant Communications**: Email campaigns (registration drive, pre-event logistics, post-event follow-up), coordinate with **Entries & Platform Management Team** on Discord announcements

**Key Challenges**:
- Differentiation (not just "another hackathon" but a genuine civic innovation lab)
- Reaching diverse participant base (avoiding homogeneous tech bro audience)
- Balancing technical depth with accessibility for community members without coding backgrounds
- Managing Mayor Avula's brand (he's attached his name to this—quality matters)

**Team Size**: 3-4 people
- **Lead**: Overall marketing strategy and brand stewardship
- **Content Creator**: Blog posts, social media, video production
- **Social Media Manager**: Daily posting, engagement, analytics
- **Media Relations**: Press outreach and event coverage coordination

**Success Metrics**:
- 300+ qualified registrations (target demographic diversity across race, gender, neighborhood)
- 10K+ social media impressions per week in lead-up to event
- 3+ media placements in Richmond outlets
- Post-event coverage highlighting winning solutions and implementation pathways

**Strategic Note**: Marketing should emphasize *outcomes* over *activity*. The story isn't "Richmond had a hackathon," it's "Richmond is solving its 11,000-unit affordable housing shortage through civic innovation." Frame this as part of Mayor Avula's legacy and Richmond's national leadership on participatory democracy. Consider creating a documentary-style recap video for post-event storytelling.
