# January-March Campaign Calendar: Tactical Breakdown

You’ve got **12 touchpoints** over 11 weeks. This is a volume play, not a precision strike—you’re building ambient awareness + multiple conversion moments. Smart.

-----

## **WEEK 1: January 6–12 (Establish Credibility)**

### **Jan 6 (Mon) – RVA JS Meetup**

**Objective:** First technical validation. Prove this isn’t vaporware.

**Pre-work:**

- Cards printed and in hand
- 5-min pitch rehearsed (ideally with slide deck on USB backup)
- QR code tested live

**Tactical notes:**

- Arrive 15 min early, cards visible on a table near entry
- During networking time, don’t pitch—just hand cards with “We’re up in 5”
- After your slot, stay for Q&A. This crowd will stress-test your feasibility claims.

**Key message:** “The City has pre-cleared open source adoption pathways. Your side project could ship to production.”

-----

### **Jan 10 (Fri) – UVA + VCU Campus Blitz**

**Objective:** Intercept students before semester commitments solidify.

**Execution:**

- Chalk + posters at high-traffic zones (dining halls, libraries, CS/engineering buildings)
- Flyers with QR code + “48-hour sprint, real City adoption”
- Hit both campuses same day if possible (Richmond campuses within 10 min drive)

**Messaging pivot for students:**

- Don’t sell “civic duty”
- Sell “portfolio piece that shipped to government + potential micro-grant”
- Frame as **capstone-eligible** or **resume differentiator**

**Compliance check:** Verify postering rules at both schools. VCU is looser; UVA may require RSO sponsorship. If so, partner with a CS/data science student org to co-host.

-----

### **Jan 12 (Sun) – City Council Meeting**

**Objective:** Get official government visibility. This is your **legitimacy anchor**.

**Tactical approach:**

- Attend public comment period (typically first 30 min)
- Wear Hack for RVA branding if you have it
- Brief remarks (<3 min): Frame as “R&D sprint to support MAP implementation”
- Directly name-drop your four council targets (Jordan, Bretton, Robertson, Abubaker) as potential Track Champions
- Hand cards to council members afterward

**Key framing:** “This isn’t asking for City funds—we’re bringing external resources to accelerate your priorities.”

**Risk mitigation:** If public comment is full, pivot to networking in the lobby after adjournment. Still counts as “showing up.”

-----

## **WEEK 2: January 13–19 (Community Activation)**

### **Jan 13 (Mon) – Beers & Bugs + Community Sticky Note Session**

**Objective:** Generate **crowd-sourced problem statements** while building grassroots energy.

**Format:**

- 7 poster boards (one per MAP pillar)
- Sticky notes at each station: “What’s broken in Richmond that tech could fix?”
- Beer + casual = lower barrier to participation
- Capture photos of filled boards → content for social media + sponsor decks

**Location scouting:**

- Manchester makes sense (Southside investment narrative)
- Need venue with wall space + permissive toward taping posters
- Brewery vs. coffee shop: Beer signals “this is fun,” coffee signals “this is work.” Pick based on vibe you want.

**Staffing:** You need 2–3 volunteers to facilitate, photograph, and collect contact info (clipboard + QR code).

**Output:** These sticky notes become **raw problem statements** you refine into challenge briefs. This is literal R&D—you’re extracting signal from lived experience.

-----

### **Jan 15 (Wed) – RVA Tech C-Suite (Nick Serfass)**

**Objective:** Corporate sponsor pipeline + executive credibility.

**The ask to Nick:**

- 5 min at opening or closing of next exec meeting
- Positioning: “We’re building a talent pipeline for civic tech contracts—here’s how your companies can plug in early”

**Pitch angle for execs:**

- This isn’t CSR theater—it’s **talent scouting + R&D outsourcing**
- Winning solutions become pilots they can scale commercially
- Track sponsorships = brand association with Mayor’s MAP (political capital)

**CTA:** “Sponsor a track ($2.5K–$5K), or send a team to compete.”

-----

### **Jan 17 (Sat) – RVA Code & Coffee**

**Objective:** Recruit **squad leaders** (team captains who can rally 3–5 others).

**Why this matters:**

- Lone wolves show up day-of and flounder
- Pre-formed squads with a captain = higher completion rates

**Tactical execution:**

- Bumper stickers as social proof (“I’m helping organize Hack for RVA”)
- Laptop demo of challenge briefs (even if rough drafts)
- Recruit people who’ve **led teams before** (hackathons, work projects, open source maintainers)

**The pitch:** “We need 10 squad leaders. You recruit your team, we’ll pair you with a City champion.”

-----

## **WEEK 5: February 3–12 (Corporate + Security Track Push)**

### **Feb 3 (Mon) – RVA JS Meetup (Return Visit)**

Brief update: “Here’s what we’ve learned since January. Tracks are locked, City partners confirmed.”

**New CTA:** “Register your team by Feb 15 for early challenge brief access.”

-----

### **Feb 6 (Thurs) – ??? Event (Context Missing)**

You said “show up with Hack for RVA T-shirts, recruit corporate teams.” Where is this? A conference? Meetup? Clarify so I can refine tactics.

**Assumption:** Some kind of tech/business networking event.

**Strategy:**

- Branded shirts = walking billboards
- Target competitive mid-career professionals (they have disposable income for registration fees if you add those later, plus they want portfolio differentiation)
- Pitch: “Your company talks about innovation. Prove it. Field a team.”

-----

### **Feb 12 (Wed) – CyberVA @ Convention Center**

**Objective:** Recruit security professionals for **Thriving City Hall** track (IT modernization, cybersecurity challenges).

**Table setup:**

- Laptop looping: “Richmond’s legacy systems need modern security architecture—help us build it”
- Challenge brief preview (even if draft): Specific problems like “City database encryption standards” or “phishing-resistant authentication for 4,500 employees”
- Swag: Stickers, cards, maybe challenge coins if budget allows

**Messaging for security pros:**

- Frame as **real-world pentesting + architecture design sprint**
- Emphasize: “This isn’t a CTF. It’s infrastructure R&D with City CISO involvement.”

**Risk:** Security folks are skeptical of “hackathon solutions” for security problems. Counter this by showing you understand the difference between a demo and a deployable system. Mention the 6-month pilot support explicitly.

-----

## **WEEK 10: March 9–20 (Final Push + Urgency Creation)**

### **Mar 9 (Sun) – City Council Hearing (Return Visit)**

**Objective:** Momentum signal. Show this thing is real and growing.

**New messaging:**

- “XX teams registered, $XX in prize pool confirmed, Y City departments committed”
- Announce Track Champions publicly if they’ve agreed
- Create FOMO: “Registration closes March 25”

-----

### **Mar 16 (Sun) – Post-Spring Break Campus Blitz**

Students are back, schedules are set, but spring break energy = openness to disruption.

**Execution:** Same as Jan 10, but now you have **proof**:

- Show photos from Beers & Bugs sticky note session
- Show logos of corporate sponsors (if any)
- Show names of City partners

**New CTA:** “Register by March 20 for team placement guarantee.”

-----

### **Mar 20 (Thurs) – Museum District Town Hall**

**Objective:** Last major public touchpoint. Convert lurkers.

**Why this venue matters:**

- Museum District = educated, civically engaged, higher income
- These are people who care about Richmond’s trajectory but may not be coders
- Opportunity to recruit **non-technical roles**: UX, policy analysts, designers, project managers

**Pitch adjustment:**

- “You don’t need to code. We need systems thinkers, researchers, and people who understand government.”
- Show the **Track Teams** structure: “Every team gets a City champion, corporate sponsor, and community partner.”

**Urgency lever:** “Registration closes in 7 days. After that, day-of registration only (if space allows).”

-----

## **Floating Priorities (No Fixed Date Yet)**

### **Op-Ed with Michael Colby**

**Timing:** Publish **2–3 weeks before the event** (early March).

**Angle:**

- “Why Richmond Needs a Civic Hackathon Now”
- Tie to MAP metrics with bad trend lines (cite specific goals from document)
- Frame as **applied R&D**, not activism
- Mention budget drop timing: “While the City debates budget priorities, we’re prototyping solutions.”

**Strategic value:**

- Legitimacy from Colby’s name
- Media pickup potential (RTD, RVA Mag, local TV)
- Content you can reshare endlessly

**Colby’s incentive:** He gets to be the thought leader on “innovation in local government.” Easy yes.

**Logistics:** Draft it yourself, send to Colby for edits/co-authorship, then shop to RTD opinion desk or publish on Medium + distribute.

-----

### **Budget Drop Leverage (Day of Hackathon)**

You mentioned this but didn’t elaborate. Clarify:

- Is the City budget announcement literally March 27–29?
- If so, how do you want to tie the hackathon to it?

**Possible angles:**

- “While leaders debate budgets, hackers are building solutions”
- “Budget constraints meet innovation: How a $15K hackathon could save the City millions”
- Live-tweet budget announcements + hackathon progress in parallel (contrast scarcity vs. abundance mindset)

**Risk:** This could feel opportunistic if not framed carefully. Michael Colby’s co-authorship on the op-ed helps neutralize that.

-----

## **What You’re Missing**

### **1. Email Drip Campaign**

You’re doing 12 in-person events but no mention of email follow-up. You need:

- **Week 1 (post-Jan 6):** “Thanks for hearing us at RVA JS—here’s the full pitch”
- **Week 4 (late Jan):** “City partners confirmed, tracks finalized”
- **Week 8 (late Feb):** “Early bird registration closing soon”
- **Week 10 (mid-Mar):** “Final call—register by March 20”

Collect emails at every touchpoint. QR code should lead to landing page with email capture.

-----

### **2. Social Proof Timeline**

When can you announce:

- First corporate sponsor?
- First City partner?
- First Track Champion?

Each of these is a **mini-launch moment**. Stagger them across January–February to maintain momentum between events.

-----

### **3. Challenge Brief Previews**

By mid-February, you need **draft challenge briefs** for at least 3 tracks. These are your conversion tools:

- Shows participants this is real
- Gives them something concrete to prep for
- Signals you’ve done the hard work of problem extraction

Use the sticky notes from Beers & Bugs as raw material.

-----

## **Revised Messaging Discipline**

You said: “Don’t need to be like civic duty… focus on technical challenges.”

**Correct. Here’s the reframe:**

### **DON’T SAY:**

- “Help your community”
- “Give back”
- “Civic engagement”

### **DO SAY:**

- “Solve real infrastructure problems”
- “Ship to production with City adoption”
- “R&D sprint with $15K+ in prizes + 6-month pilot support”
- “Build something that scales beyond a demo”

### **For different audiences:**

**Developers:**
“The City wants to adopt your side project. Open source, pre-cleared legal pathways, mentorship from City IT.”

**Students:**
“Portfolio piece that shipped to government. Resume differentiator. Potential micro-grant for pilot.”

**Corporate teams:**
“Talent pipeline for civic tech contracts. R&D outsourcing. Brand association with Mayor’s MAP.”

**Security pros:**
“Real-world infrastructure hardening. Not a CTF. City CISO involvement.”

**Non-technical:**
“Systems thinking + policy analysis. We need researchers, designers, and people who understand government.”

-----

## **Next 48 Hours**

1. **Order business cards** (VistaPrint, 500 min, design locked by EOD)
1. **Email Nick Serfass** (lock Jan 15 slot for RVA Tech C-Suite)
1. **Draft 5-min RVA JS pitch** (slides + script, rehearse 3x)
1. **Scout Beers & Bugs venue** (confirm wall space + taping policy)
1. **Email Michael Colby** (float op-ed idea, propose co-authorship)

Everything else sequences from these.

**What’s the status on:**

- Landing page (is [hackforrva.com](http://hackforrva.com) live)?
- First sponsor (who are you pitching for the $500–$1K)?
- Track Team assignments (which corporate/community partners are locked)?

Give me those three answers and I’ll refine the next layer.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
