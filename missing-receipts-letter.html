    RE: Missing Receipts for Staff Travel Meal Expenses

  <div class="salutation">
    Dear Supervisor,
  </div>
  
  <div class="body">
    <p>
      I am writing to formally acknowledge and explain the absence of receipts for the following 
      credit card transactions incurred during staff travel:
    </p>
    
    <table class="expense-table">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Date</th>
          <th>Category</th>
          <th>Description</th>
          <th>Amount (USD)</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>December 1, 2025</td>
          <td>Staff Travel - Meals</td>
          <td>Meal expense</td>
          <td>$3.50</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>December 2, 2025</td>
          <td>Staff Travel - Meals</td>
          <td>Meal expense</td>
          <td>$4.49</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>December 2, 2025</td>
          <td>Staff Travel - Meals</td>
          <td>Meal expense (Ref: 1202170533)</td>
          <td>$15.57</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
      <tfoot>
        <tr>
          <td colspan="3">Total</td>
          <td>$23.56</td>
        </tr>
      </tfoot>
    </table>
    
    <p>
      I must confess that at the time of these purchases, I was paralyzed by hunger. As anyone 
      who has experienced the urgent and all-consuming nature of hunger pangs can attest, rational 
      thought processes—including the critical habit of requesting receipts—become secondary to the 
      immediate physiological imperative of obtaining sustenance. In those moments, my cognitive 
      resources were entirely devoted to locating and consuming food, leaving no mental bandwidth 
      for administrative considerations.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I understand that receipts are an essential component of proper expense documentation and 
      financial accountability. I take full responsibility for this oversight and sincerely apologize 
      for any inconvenience this may cause to the accounting and reimbursement process.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I hereby certify that these expenses were legitimate business-related meal purchases incurred 
      during authorized staff travel. I commit to being more vigilant in the future, perhaps by 
      carrying emergency snacks to prevent such hunger-induced administrative lapses.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Please let me know if there are any additional forms or documentation required to process 
      these expenses without the original receipts.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Thank you for your understanding.
    </p>

    Respectfully submitted,
