# Lovable Website Content Sync Plan
## RVA Hacks - Knowledge Base → Website Migration Strategy

**Document Purpose:** Step-by-step plan for migrating content from the knowledge base to the Lovable website, establishing a repeatable workflow for ongoing updates and new pages.

**Last Updated:** November 12, 2025
**Status:** DRAFT - Ready for Review and Implementation

---

## Executive Summary

The RVA Hacks knowledge base contains **40-50 files** suitable for website migration across 6-8 directories. This plan:

1. **Prioritizes content** by urgency and impact (3 phases)
2. **Maps KB content to website pages** (content-to-page matrix)
3. **Establishes repeatable workflows** for ongoing updates
4. **Defines roles & responsibilities** for content sync
5. **Provides step-by-step instructions** for each content type
6. **Creates a sustainable content management process** as you add new pages

**Key Principle:** The knowledge base is the single source of truth. Website updates follow KB updates, never the reverse.

**When KB Content Changes:**

1. **Identify Changed Content**
   - File path
   - What changed (new, updated, or deleted)
   - Reason for change

2. **Assess Website Impact**
   - Which pages reference this KB file?
   - Is update urgent or can it wait for next batch?
   - Does it require new pages or just updates to existing pages?

3. **Make Website Updates**
   - Update the affected component(s)
   - Add/update JSDoc comment: `// See knowledge-base/XX/file.md (updated Nov 12)`
   - Test the changes locally
   - Ensure formatting matches KB content

4. **Commit & Document**
   - Git commit: `feat: sync KB updates from [KB file] to [pages]`
   - Include reference to KB file path and date
   - Link to the KB commit if applicable

5. **Deploy**
   - Test on staging
   - Deploy to production
   - No reverse sync - KB stays unchanged

**Example:**
```
KB Change: hackathon-one-pager.md updated with new challenge description

Website Impact Assessment:
- Challenges.tsx (challenge list) - NEEDS UPDATE
- Home/Index.tsx (mentions challenges) - No change needed
- FAQ.tsx (challenge descriptions) - NEEDS UPDATE

Action:
- Update src/components/Challenges.tsx with new description
- Update src/pages/Index.tsx if needed
- Add comment: // See knowledge-base/01-planning-strategy/hackathon-one-pager.md
- Commit: "feat: update challenge descriptions from KB"
- Test and deploy

KB: Unchanged (source of truth)
App: Updated (implementation reflects KB)
```

---

### Creating New Pages from KB Content

**When you want to add a new website page:**

1. **Identify the need**
   - What information should this page show?
   - What pages/sections link to it?

2. **Find KB content**
   - Search knowledge-base/ for relevant files
   - Identify primary source (one main file + supporting references)
   - Check if content is complete or marked TBD

3. **Create the page component**
   - Create `/src/pages/NewPage.tsx` or `/src/components/NewComponent.tsx`
   - Add JSDoc header with KB references:
     ```typescript
     /**
      * NewPage component
      *
      * Content sourced from:
      * - knowledge-base/XX/file1.md (primary)
      * - knowledge-base/XX/file2.md (supporting)
      */
     ```

4. **Implement content**
   - Pull content directly from KB files
   - Adapt formatting for web (headers, lists, etc.)
   - Link to original KB file in comments for sections

5. **Add to navigation**
   - Update Navigation.tsx
   - Add to routing if needed (in App.tsx or router config)

6. **Test & deploy**
   - Local testing
   - Staging review
   - Production deployment

7. **Document the mapping**
   - Update Part 2 of this plan with the new page
   - Add to "Pages" section in this document

**Example:**
```
New Page: GetInvolved.tsx

Step 1: Need identified - Users ask "How can I help?"

Step 2: KB content found:
- knowledge-base/04-partnerships/sponsor-outreach-process.md (how to sponsor)
- knowledge-base/04-partnerships/sponsor-perks-engagement.md (benefits)
- knowledge-base/05-event-operations/volunteer-management.md (how to volunteer)

Step 3: Create component with JSDoc

Step 4: Implement three sections: Sponsor, Volunteer, Mentor

Step 5: Add to Navigation.tsx and routing

Step 6: Test & deploy

Step 7: Update LOVABLE-SYNC-PLAN.md Part 2 with new page mapping
```

### Handling KB "TBD" Content

**When KB content is incomplete (marked TBD):**

1. **Identify the TBD**
   - What's missing?
   - Who needs to provide it?
   - When is it due?

2. **Option A: Placeholder in App**
   ```typescript
   // See knowledge-base/08/registration.md
   // TODO: KB TBD - Registration platform selection pending (due Jan 1)
   // For now, show: "Registration opens January 2026"
   ```

3. **Option B: Conditional Rendering**
   ```typescript
   {registrationPlatform === 'TBD' ? (
     <p>Registration details coming soon</p>
   ) : (
     <RegistrationForm platform={registrationPlatform} />
   )}
   ```

4. **Option C: Feature Flag**
   - Hide incomplete section behind feature flag
   - Enable when KB content is finalized

5. **Follow Up**
   - Email KB owner/maintainer
   - Flag in PR comments
   - Update KB with deadline if missing
   - Track in ACTION-ITEMS-ASAP.md

---

### Content Version Control

**Linking App Code to KB Versions:**

Each component should cite which KB file version it's based on:

```typescript
/**
 * EventFormat Component
 *
 * Content sources (version control):
 * - EVENT-FORMAT.md (last updated Oct 31, 2025)
 *   - Schedule: 33-hour format (Friday 9 AM - Sunday 12 PM)
 *   - Paths: 4 participation options
 * - what-to-expect.md (last updated Oct 25, 2025)
 *   - Team composition guidance
 *   - Detailed schedule
 *
 * TODO: Update component after KB changes (tracking via git commits)
 */
```

When KB file updates, update the "last updated" date in the JSDoc comment.

### Specific Instructions by Content Type

#### Type 1: Content Lists (e.g., team members, challenges, partners)

**Example:** Syncing team members from `02-team-governance/README.md` to `Team.tsx`

**Steps:**
1. Open KB file and find team member list
2. Extract name, role, photo filename from KB
3. Create array in component:
   ```typescript
   // See knowledge-base/02-team-governance/README.md
   const teamMembers = [
     { name: "Ford Prior", role: "Vision, Strategy", photo: "ford-prior.jpg" },
     // ...
   ];
   ```
4. Map over array in JSX to render team members
5. Add comment linking to KB file

---

#### Type 2: Descriptive Content (e.g., event format, what to expect)

**Example:** Syncing event description from `01-planning-strategy/hackathon-one-pager.md` to `About.tsx`

**Steps:**
1. Copy relevant sections from KB
2. Identify main heading, subheadings, paragraphs
3. Implement in component:
   ```typescript
   // See knowledge-base/01-planning-strategy/hackathon-one-pager.md
   export function EventStory() {
     return (
       <section>
         <h2>What We're Building</h2>
         <p>// Paragraph from KB...</p>
         <h3>The Opportunity</h3>
         <p>// Content from KB...</p>
       </section>
     );
   }
   ```
4. Add citations in comments for each section

---

#### Type 3: Timeline/Schedule (e.g., event schedule, run of show)

**Example:** Syncing schedule from `05-event-operations/EVENT-FORMAT.md` to `EventFormat.tsx`

**Steps:**
1. Extract timeline data from KB (dates, times, events)
2. Create timeline data structure:
   ```typescript
   // See knowledge-base/05-event-operations/EVENT-FORMAT.md
   const schedule = [
     { time: "9:00 AM", event: "Check-in opens", day: "Friday" },
     { time: "10:00 AM", event: "Opening Ceremony", day: "Friday" },
     // ...
   ];
   ```
3. Create Timeline component or use visual timeline library
4. Map data to render timeline
5. Add comment with KB reference

---

#### Type 4: Q&A Content (e.g., FAQ)

**Example:** Creating FAQ from multiple KB files

**Steps:**
1. Search all KB files for common questions
2. Extract Q&A pairs from files like what-to-expect.md, registration.md, etc.
3. Create FAQ data structure:
   ```typescript
   // Sources:
   // - knowledge-base/08-participant-experience/what-to-expect.md
   // - knowledge-base/08-participant-experience/registration.md
   // - knowledge-base/05-event-operations/EVENT-FORMAT.md
   const faqs = [
     {
       q: "What's a civic hackathon?",
       a: "// Content from what-to-expect.md"
     },
     // ...
   ];
   ```
4. Render with accordion or expand/collapse component
5. Add citations in data structure

## Part 6: Content Management System

### Tracking Content Changes

**Create a "Content Sync Log" to track updates:**

```
Knowledge Base Content Sync Log
================================

Date       | KB File                              | Change               | Website Pages Affected | Status      | Deployed
-----------|--------------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|-------------|----------
Nov 12     | hackathon-one-pager.md              | Updated challenge    | Challenges, Home       | ✓ Synced   | ✓ Nov 12
Nov 12     | 08-participant/registration.md      | TBD → Platform TBD   | Registration.tsx       | ⏳ Waiting  | —
Nov 11     | 05-event-ops/EVENT-FORMAT.md        | New schedule         | EventFormat, FAQ       | ✓ Synced   | ✓ Nov 11
Nov 10     | 04-partnerships/README.md           | Added new partner    | Partners.tsx           | ✓ Synced   | ✓ Nov 10
```

**Where to maintain this log:**
- Option 1: In this document (Part 6 section)

## Part 8: Common Questions & Troubleshooting

### Q: What if KB content changes after I've implemented it on the website?

**A:** Update the website page using the standard workflow:
1. Note what changed in KB
2. Update affected website pages
3. Update JSDoc comment with new date
4. Commit with reference to KB file
5. Deploy

No reverse sync—KB stays as source of truth.

---

### Q: What if I find the website should be different from what KB says?

**A:** Flag it for human review. Don't change KB from code. Instead:
1. Add code comment: `// NOTE: Consider KB update - this implementation uses X instead of Y because...`
2. Create GitHub issue tagged "KB-Review"
3. Let human developer decide if KB should be updated
4. If KB updates, update code accordingly

---

### Q: What if KB has a TBD but we need to launch the website?

**A:** Use placeholder content:
1. Add `// TODO: KB TBD` comment
2. Show temporary message: "Coming soon" or placeholder
3. Keep implementation structure ready for real content
4. Track in ACTION-ITEMS-ASAP.md with deadline
5. Update when KB content is finalized

---

### Q: How do I know which KB file to use for a page?

**A:** Check Part 2 (Content-to-Page Mapping) of this document. It lists:
- Which KB files feed into each page
- What content to extract
- Any TBDs or pending decisions

---

### Q: Should I ever update the knowledge base from the website code?

**A:** **NO.** Never. The workflow is strictly:
- KB (human updates) → Website (developer implements)
- Not: Website → KB

If you discover KB should update, ask the human who maintains KB.

---

### Q: What if a KB file is incomplete or outdated?

**A:** Add a note in the code:
```typescript
// NOTE: See knowledge-base/XX/file.md - marked as draft/incomplete
// Human review needed before full implementation
```

And flag it in a GitHub issue for KB owner to review.

---

### Q: How do I handle images, logos, PDFs from KB?

**A:**
- Images: Check `src/assets/` - if not there, request from KB owner
- Logos (Partners.pdf): Extract and save to `src/assets/logos/`
- PDFs: Link to PDF in KB repo or host on website
- Always cite where the asset came from in JSDoc comment

---

## Part 9: Tools & References

### Files to Reference

- **This document:** `/LOVABLE-SYNC-PLAN.md`
- **Cursor rules:** `.cursorrules`
- **Agent guidelines:** `knowledge-base/AGENTS.md`
- **Custom knowledge:** (In Lovable UI, not file)
- **KB content:** `knowledge-base/` directory

### Git Commands

```bash
# See KB file changes
git log knowledge-base/XX/filename.md

# See which website files reference a KB file
grep -r "knowledge-base/XX" src/

# Create a new page
git checkout -b feat/new-page

# Commit KB sync
git commit -m "feat: sync [KB file] to [Page name]"
```

### Lovable Tips

- Use lovable-website-prompts.md to generate component designs
- Reference brand guidelines in custom knowledge
- Use component library consistently (shadcn/ui)
- Keep styling in Tailwind, not inline CSS

---

## Part 10: Success Metrics

### How to measure if the sync plan is working

**Metrics:**
1. **Content Freshness:** All website content updated within 2 weeks of KB changes
2. **Citation Rate:** 100% of public content has JSDoc KB reference
3. **Hardcoded Content:** 0 pieces of hardcoded content without KB source
4. **TBD Items:** All tracked and assigned owner + deadline
5. **Sync Latency:** Average time from KB change to website deployment < 7 days
6. **Build Status:** Always green (no broken builds)
7. **KB-App Conflicts:** < 1 per month (and resolved within 48 hours)

### Database Dashboard Requirements

**Registration Dashboard (P1):**
- Total registrations with daily trend
- Breakdown by type (VIP, public, corporate, student, city employee)
- Diversity pipeline count (target: 30 by Feb 28)
- Squad Leader recruitment funnel
- Referral code performance

**Sponsorship Dashboard (P2):**
- Pipeline by status (prospect → paid)
- Revenue by tier
- Perks utilization

**Engagement Dashboard (P3):**
- Council member status (9 total, target: 7 committed)
- Track Champion status (7 total, all confirmed by Feb 21)
- Weekly metrics vs. targets (with alerts if below target)

**Day-of Dashboard (P4):**
- Check-in status
- Live registration count

---

### Contingency Triggers (Built into Metrics)

```
IF total_registrations < 50 BY Jan 17:
  → Double LinkedIn ad spend
  → Add Facebook ads
  → Alert: "Registration below target"

IF total_registrations < 150 BY Feb 21:
  → Email blast to all .edu addresses
  → Alert: "Activate emergency outreach"

IF sponsors_count < 3 BY Feb 21:
  → Escalate to board
  → Reduce scope/budget
```
