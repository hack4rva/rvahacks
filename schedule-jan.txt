# January Sprint Strategy: Problem Extraction + Solver Recruitment
## Critical Path Items
### 1. **Cash Flow (URGENT)**
You need $500–$1,000 in the bank immediately. This isn’t operating budget—this is credibility capital. Without it, you’re pitching vapor.
**Options hierarchy:**
Church route (uncertain, but fastest if viable)
Angel sponsor (individual, not corporate—faster decision cycle)
Pre-commit from a corporate partner (slower, but higher ceiling)
**Key question:** What’s the minimum viable sponsor ask that gets you to $1K? Is this:
Logo placement at event?
Named track sponsorship?
Early adopter positioning (“Founding Sponsor” branding)?
You need a 30-second pitch that converts on urgency without desperation.
-----
### 2. **Framing Discipline: R&D, Not Activism**
This is essential for City buy-in and corporate sponsors. The language matters:
**Don’t say:**
“Civic engagement”
“Community organizing”
“Grassroots solutions”
**Do say:**
“Applied R&D sprint”
“Rapid prototyping lab”
“Innovation pipeline for municipal deployment”
“48-hour feasibility testing”
This positions winners as **pilots**, not protests. It signals you understand implementation constraints, procurement pathways, and institutional risk tolerance.
-----
## Three-Bucket Outreach Strategy
### **Government Bucket**
**Target Council Members:**
Catherine Jordan (District 2)
Andrew Bretton (District 1)
Ellen Robertson (District 6)
Sarah Abubaker (District 4)
**The Ask:**
**Not:** “Support our hackathon”
**Instead:** “Champion a track aligned with your district priorities”
Each council member becomes a **Track Team City Partner**. They get:
Direct access to solutions addressing their constituents’ pain points
First-look at deployable tools (political capital)
Association with innovation narrative without needing to fund it
**Pitch angle by district:**
**District 1 (Bretton):** Southside investment, economic mobility
**District 2 (Jordan):** Housing affordability, neighborhood amenities
**District 4 (Abubaker):** Youth programs, education pipeline
**District 6 (Robertson):** Infrastructure, sustainability, zoning
This isn’t scattershot—each council member gets **one track** that aligns with their known policy focus areas from the MAP.
-----
### **Education Bucket**
You didn’t specify universities, but the implicit targets are:
**VCU** (urban design, social work, public policy, data science)
**University of Richmond** (Bonner Center, business school)
**Virginia Union** (HBCU alignment with equity tracks)
**The Play:**
Target **professors** running capstone courses or research labs
Position this as **course credit-eligible** or **research output opportunity**
Get students to show up with faculty endorsement (credibility + structure)
**Specific pitch:** “Your Spring 2026 capstone could pilot a solution the City actually adopts—not a shelf project.”
-----
### **Tech Bucket**
**Target Groups for 5-Minute Pitches:**
RVA JS
Java User Group
PyRVA (Python)
RVA Data Science Group
**Pitch structure (5 min max):**
**Hook:** “The City wants to adopt your side project” (30 sec)
**The Problem:** Show 1–2 real MAP metrics with bad trend lines (60 sec)
**The Opportunity:** Open source + City mentorship + micro-grants (90 sec)
**The CTA:** “Sign up at [hackforrva.com](http://hackforrva.com), or talk to me after” (30 sec)
**Q&A buffer** (90 sec)
**Key framing:** This isn’t a hackathon where demos die. It’s a **procurement on-ramp**. The legal pathways are pre-cleared. The City champions are named. The 6-month support is real.
-----
## Scheduling + Logistics
### **January 6 Event** (You cut off mid-sentence)
What’s happening January 6? Assuming this is your first outreach milestone—clarify so I can sequence dependencies.
-----
### **Data & AI Summit Booth**
**Blocker:** Aaron Baker approval for DIY booth.
**Immediate action:**
Draft the ask email to Aaron **today**
Position it as “early validation opportunity” for the summit (you’re bringing hackers who might attend the full event)
Offer to staff it entirely yourselves (zero lift for Aaron)
**Booth goal:** Collect emails + distribute cards. This is a **lead gen station**, not a sales pitch. Simple setup:
Laptop looping a 60-second sizzle reel
QR code to registration
Physical cards with elevator pitch on back
**Budget:** <$100 if you’re scrappy (posterboard + printouts + QR stickers).
-----
## Business Cards (ASAP)
**Minimum viable card:**
Front: Logo + “Hack for RVA” + “March 27–29, 2026”
Back: QR code to landing page + one-line pitch (“48-hour civic tech sprint. Real problems. Real adoption.”)
**Print volume:** 500 cards minimum. You’ll burn through these faster than you think.
**Vendor:** VistaPrint (cheap, fast) or local print shop if you want to support RVA business.
**Timeline:** Order by end of this week to have them for January meetups.
-----
## What’s Missing
I need clarity on:
**January 6 context** – What’s the event/milestone?
**Sponsor pitch materials** – Do you have a one-pager? Slide deck?
**Landing page status** – Is [hackforrva.com](http://hackforrva.com) live? What’s the conversion path?
**Track Team assignments** – Which corporate/community partners are locked for which tracks?
**Legal pathway documentation** – Can you show potential participants the pre-cleared open source adoption process? This is your differentiation.
Without these, you’re selling air. With them, you’re selling infrastructure.
-----
## Next 72 Hours
**Do these in order:**
**Finalize sponsor ask** (draft email/pitch)
**Order business cards** (lock design, submit print job)
**Email Aaron Baker** (Data & AI Summit booth)
**Draft 5-min tech meetup pitch** (script + slides)
**Reach out to Council members** (personalized ask per district)
Everything else is noise until these are moving.
